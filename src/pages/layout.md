# Welcome to the valley

This site is a notebook devoted to my OO gauge model railway, Guelder Valley. It’s a central place where I keep information about the trains I run on it, as well as the build process as time goes on.

The layout is named after the street I live on, Guelder Rose.

## About the layout

Guelder Valley is a layout primarily based in the United Kingdom at the time of Early British Railways, 1948-1956. This is often referred to as “Era 4” by the manufacturers.

At this point in time, the UK’s “Big Four” railway companies had just been merged into a single company, British Railways. Steam locomotives were dominant, but toward the end of the era in-routes were being made into using smaller diesel locomotives as well.

Since this model railway has been collected over many years, there are several other locomotives which do not fit into the era depicted. They are marked as “In Storage” in the parts lists. I may consider modernising the layout in the future to include them.
