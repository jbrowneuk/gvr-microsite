# GVR Railway Micro-Site

Originally started as an informal way to share project updates for my model railway. Now acts as a playground for more advanced features to be backported to my portfolio software [jblog](https://github.com/jbrowneuk/jblog).

It uses the same build toolchain as jblog, so the instructions there are valid here.
